# README

This is a twitter clone based off the 2015 twitter using Ruby on Rails and BootStrap. 

I have implemented the ability to sign up, sign in, tweet, view other users, edit your profile, upload pictures for your avatar, and the use of hash-tags. When a hashtag is created it can be clicked on and directs user to a page with all the tweets that have
used the same hash-tag.

Some of the gems that were used to create this include; CarrierWave, Paperclip, jquery, and font-awesome.
